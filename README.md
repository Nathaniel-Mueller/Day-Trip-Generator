# Day Trip Generator

This is a simple randomizer that will pull variables from a few different lists to create a day plan for the user. The user can choose
to reselect each of the options multiple times if they desire, and the user is asked to approve the new day plan before the program is complete.

This program should follow the following criteria:

As a developer, I want to make at least three commits with descriptive messages.

As a developer, I want to store my destinations, restaurants, mode of transportation, and entertainment selections in their own separate lists.

As a user, I want a destination to be randomly selected for my day trip.

As a user, I want a restaurant to be randomly selected for my day trip.

As a user, I want a mode of transportation to be randomly selected for my day trip.

As a user, I want a form of entertainment to be randomly selected for my day trip.

As a user, I want to be able to randomly re-select a destination, restaurant, mode of transportation, and/or form of entertainment if I don’t like one or more of those things.

As a user, I want to be able to confirm that my day trip is “complete” once I like all of the random selections.

As a user, I want to display my completed trip in the console.

As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing!
